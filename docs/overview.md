Overview
- A team of agents working together to develop software projects
	- Need to have a messaging pipeline, task queue and scheduler, a resource manager for viewing memory/resource management and allocating tasks when resources are available
- Potentially will connect with API calls to online LLMs for harder tasks
- Can initially use logs, but will eventually want some kind of gui to monitor queue, agents, tasks/tasks completed, etc.

## Task Breakdowns
head architect, senior software dev, project manager, junior devs, test dev agent
- Architect breaks project down into smaller tasks and adds them to the task queue, organizes project
- Project manager divides tasks up and helps schedule them according to available resources
- Test development agent creates unit tests for each chunk of code to provide test coverage for the whole project
- Smaller models (junior devs) complete coding subtasks which are then checked by the senior dev, placed into the proper space in the codespace and updated if they can be improved/optimized or are wrong
	- [!idea] could use this feedback from the senior dev to help train smaller models in the future
	- agents provide confidence on tasks and when confidence is low, turn to other agents for help if possible, otherwise pause task to wait for user input and move forward with other tasks
		- [!future goal] Could use API calls instead of local agents when stuck
			- Need to limit usage/costs when this happens

**1. Core Components:**

- **Task Queue:**
    
    - **Technology:** Redis (or similar in-memory data store) for its speed and flexibility. Could use a different queueing solution, but Redis is a good starting point for simple tasks
        
    - **Functionality:** Holds tasks generated by the Architect, prioritized by urgency/dependency. Each task includes:
        - Task ID
        - Description
        - Assigned Agent (initially null)
        - Dependencies (other task IDs)
        - Priority
        - Status (pending, in_progress, completed, failed)
        - Resource requirements (estimated memory, model size, etc.)
        - Output location (e.g., file path)
    
- **Scheduler:**
    - **Technology:** A lightweight Python service (or similar) running periodically.
    - **Functionality:**
        - Monitors the Task Queue for pending tasks.
        - Checks available resources (memory, model capacity, agent availability) via the Resource Manager.
        - Assigns tasks to appropriate agents based on resource availability, agent capabilities, and task dependencies.
        - Updates the Task Queue with the assigned agent and status.

- **Resource Manager:**
    - **Technology:** A Python service (or similar) with access to system resources, agent model info
    - **Functionality:**
        - Tracks the current resource usage (CPU, memory, GPU/TPU utilization).
        - Tracks the availability and capacity of each agent (model size, confidence on task type)
        - Provides an API for the Scheduler to query resource availability.
        - Provides an API for Agents to report resource usage during task execution.
        - Logs historical resource usage and provides analytics.
    
- **Message Pipeline:**
    - **Technology:** RabbitMQ, Redis Pub/Sub, or simple HTTP for local development, a more robust system can be added later.
    - **Functionality:**
        - Facilitates communication between agents (e.g., Senior Dev to Junior Dev for feedback, Agents to Project Manager for status updates)    
        - Supports different message types, such as task_update, feedback, request_help
            
- **Code Repository:**
    - **Technology:** Git repository (local or remote).
    - **Functionality:**
        - Stores the project codebase.    
        - Tracks changes, version history.    
        - Agents interact with this via command-line or API (pygit2, gitpython)    

**2. AI Agents:**
- **Head Architect:**
    - **Model:** Larger model, likely the same as senior developer model
    - **Responsibilities:**
        - Breaks down the overall project into smaller, manageable tasks.    
        - Adds these tasks to the Task Queue with dependencies and priorities.
            
- **Project Manager:**
    - **Model:** smaller, faster model    
    - **Responsibilities:**    
        - Monitors the Task Queue and resource usage.        
        - Assists the Scheduler in task assignment based on priorities, resource availability, and agent expertise.        
        - Sends high-level status updates.        
        - Manages the overall schedule of tasks
            
- **Senior Software Dev:**
    - **Model:** Larger model, similar to architect    
    - **Responsibilities:**        
        - Reviews code generated by Junior Devs.        
        - Provides feedback, code improvements, optimization suggestions.        
        - Updates code in the Code Repository.
        - Trains junior devs through this feedback loop
            
- **Junior Devs (Multiple Instances):**
    - **Model:** Smaller, faster model for code generation    
    - **Responsibilities:**    
        - Receive assigned tasks from the Task Queue.        
        - Generate code based on task descriptions.        
        - Provide confidence level on the code produce
        - Request help from Senior Dev or external LLM when confidence is low or when stuck.
            
- **Test Dev Agent:**
    - **Model:** Medium sized model capable of generating tests    
    - **Responsibilities:**    
        - Creates unit tests for each code block developed.        
        - Runs unit tests on each integration of new code, making sure everything works as planned.        

**3. External API Connection:**
- **Component:** API Gateway or a dedicated service for making requests to remote LLM providers.
- **Functionality:**
    - Agents can request help from external LLMs when local models are unable to complete a task or reach a satisfactory confidence level.    
    - Includes logic to limit usage based on defined parameters to prevent excessive spending on API calls.    
    - Supports multiple provider APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
